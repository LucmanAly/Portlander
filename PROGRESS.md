# PROGRESS.md — Portlander live status

**Last updated:** 2026-08-01
**Last agent:** claude (session 14)
**Current phase:** Phase 1.5 — SnapTrade brokerage sync live (Personal-auth mode, `snaptrade-sync` v18 / `snaptrade-connect` v17). Owner still needs to click "Connect brokerage" end-to-end at least once — that's the only unverified step left.

> **Protocol:** Read `AGENTS.md` + this file before work; update this file after work without being asked. Trimmed 2026-08-01 (225 → 112 lines) after session-log bloat crept back in — old debugging narrative for *resolved* issues was cut in favor of the Decisions table (the "why," kept) over the session-by-session "what we tried" (cut). Keep new entries short.

## Snapshot

Single source of truth for current state. If it's here, don't re-explain it elsewhere in this file.

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Local app (UI shell, scoring, CSV, demo) | ✅ Done | Premium dark app, Today/Calendar/Portfolio/Settings |
| Supabase project `vvstmdnnpjnfvueoecwl` | ✅ Live | Schema (`holdings`/`watchlist`/`events`/`sync_runs`/`snaptrade_users`/`snaptrade_connections`) applied. Only advisories are pre-existing/expected (see Decisions) |
| Netlify | ✅ Live | `https://portlander.netlify.app`, git-linked to `main` |
| `sync-events` Edge Function | ✅ Live (v14) | Global/unscoped, `verify_jwt: true`. Macro rows (FOMC/CPI/NFP) come from the static, hand-verified `supabase/functions/_shared/macro-calendar.ts` — no more heuristic generation |
| Daily cron | ✅ Live | `pg_cron` job `daily-sync-events`, `0 11 * * *` UTC. Retune via `select cron.alter_job(1, schedule => '<expr>');` |
| `refresh-quotes` Edge Function | ✅ Live (v2) | User-scoped, manual "Refresh prices" control. Persists `day_change_value`/`day_change_pct` |
| `snaptrade-sync` / `snaptrade-connect` | ✅ Live (v18 / v17) | Personal-auth mode by default (`SNAPTRADE_AUTH_MODE`). Reconciles sold positions (`seenTickers` diff+delete). Owner click-test still pending — see Blockers |
| Portfolio table + CSV | ✅ Rebuilt | Configurable columns, per-row writes (PR 5), CSV Merge/Replace picker with preview counts |
| Phase 1 exit criteria | 🟡 2 of 5 met | See checklist below |

---

## Phase 1 checklist

- [x] Scaffold, cloud deploy (Netlify + Supabase + `sync-events` + cron), owner signed in with a real synced book
- [x] Calendar/Today UI fixes + manual "Refresh prices" (PR #4 → `develop`)
- [ ] Phase 1 exit criteria formally signed off:
  - [x] Real portfolio loadable; earnings from Finnhub, not demo offsets
  - [ ] Weight ranking + exposure % sanity (math unchanged, not yet owner-verified)
  - [ ] Snappy UI (fixes live on `develop`, awaiting confirmation)
  - [ ] Used on a real morning once

### SnapTrade (new scope, not in original AGENTS.md plan)
- [x] Schema (`snaptrade_users` lockbox, `snaptrade_connections`, `holdings.source`/`day_change_*`), both Edge Functions, Settings "Brokerage" UI
- [x] Personal-vs-Commercial auth root cause found and fixed (`SNAPTRADE_AUTH_MODE`, defaults to `personal`) — see Decisions
- [x] "Position fully sold" gap fixed (v18) — reconciliation not yet exercised against a real sell, since the connect→sync flow has never completed end-to-end
- [ ] **Owner: click "Connect brokerage" once more.** Nothing to configure — needs no new secrets. If it errors, the message names the SnapTrade code and the fix.

## Next up (ordered)

1. **Owner:** click "Connect brokerage" → link Fidelity → "Sync now". Then merge/close PR #13 (draft → develop, https://github.com/LucmanAly/Portlander/pull/13) — it's just sitting open.
2. **Owner:** click-test "Refresh prices" too, if not already done.
3. **Owner (optional):** retune the `11:00 UTC` cron time to your timezone.
4. **Owner (still open since session 5):** check Netlify → Deploy contexts — Deploy Previews for PRs may burn build minutes separately from `main` pushes.
5. Mark Phase 1 exit criteria formally once the above are confirmed.
6. PR 6 (score recalibration) is next per `docs/PLAN-2026-08.md`'s dependency order. Phase 2 (prep cards, journal, alerts) can proceed in parallel once Phase 1 is signed off.

**Open discussion, not a task yet:** Finnhub rate-limit strategy for PE ratio/market cap later. Verified: 60 calls/min free tier, no daily cap, bulk earnings-calendar mode exists (omit `symbol`). Owner hasn't decided whether to build this.

---

## Blockers

- **None outstanding on SnapTrade code.** What remains is verification, not a blocker: the connect → Fidelity → sync path has never run end-to-end, so treat it as unproven until the owner confirms a real sync.

(Resolved blockers are deleted, not kept. Ambient MCP-connector disconnects/reconnects are not a project blocker.)

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-07-31 | Cloud mode un-deferred; `develop` branch workflow adopted | Netlify's production branch is `main`; pushing to `develop` costs no build minutes, so PRs target `develop` and only merge to `main` when ready to ship |
| 2026-07-31 | Daily cron via `pg_cron`/`pg_net` (SQL), not a dashboard tab; `net.http_post` timeout raised to 60s | The dashboard "Schedules" tab this file used to reference doesn't exist. A real sync takes ~16s server-side; `pg_net`'s 5s default was logging a misleading timeout even though the function completed fine |
| 2026-07-31 | Added `refresh-quotes`, the project's first **user-scoped** Edge Function | Click-only "Refresh prices" for live `holdings.last_price`, decoupled from the daily earnings cron. Resolves caller's `user_id` from JWT, writes via partial update, never a full-row upsert. `verify_jwt: true` mandatory |
| 2026-07-31 | SnapTrade owns *what you own* (`snaptrade-sync`); Finnhub owns *what it's worth* (`refresh-quotes`) | `snaptrade-sync`'s upsert omits `last_price`/`day_change_*` so `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` never touches those columns |
| 2026-07-31 | `snaptrade_users` (holds the SnapTrade `userSecret`) has RLS enabled with **zero** policies | Standard Postgres lockbox pattern — only the service-role key can touch it. Shows up as the expected `rls_enabled_no_policy` INFO lint, not a real finding |
| 2026-07-31 | `snaptrade-connect`/`snaptrade-sync` use the official `snaptrade-typescript-sdk` via Deno's `npm:` specifier | Every method/field access verified directly against the real SDK source (`.d.ts`/`.mjs` from the npm tarball), not docs or guesses — this is how every real SnapTrade bug below was actually found, not from reasoning about docs |
| 2026-08-01 | Established "surface real errors in the client, not the logs" as the debugging pattern for Edge Functions | Supabase's `get_logs` MCP tool never surfaces `console.error` output — only the HTTP boundary line. `describeFunctionError()` in `snaptradeRepository.ts` reads the real JSON error body off `error.context` instead (supabase-js's `FunctionsHttpError.message` is always generic) |
| 2026-08-01 | SnapTrade: support **both** Personal and Commercial API key models behind `SNAPTRADE_AUTH_MODE`, defaulting to `personal`, gated to one owner user | A fresh key pair returned SnapTrade's own `1012` error ("registerUser is not available for personal keys") — settled the question directly. The SDK enforces the split per endpoint (`userId`/`userSecret` typed `never` in personal mode). Personal mode auto-resolves the owner when there's exactly one auth user, else requires `SNAPTRADE_OWNER_USER_ID` — refuses to guess with ≥2 users, since a Personal key always returns the key owner's own brokerage account regardless of caller |
| 2026-08-01 | Macro calendar (FOMC/CPI/NFP) replaced with a static, hand-verified table instead of the plan's original ask for hardcoded dates "through 2027" | The old `buildMacroEvents()` heuristic fabricated dates with no connection to real Fed/BLS schedules. `supabase/functions/_shared/macro-calendar.ts` tables only what's officially published as of 2026-08-01 (2026 FOMC confirmed, 2027 FOMC marked `estimated` per the Fed's own "tentative" label, CPI/NFP through their published horizon) and stops there rather than extrapolating. Extend it from primary sources directly when stale, not by pattern-matching existing rows |
| 2026-08-01 | `snaptrade-sync`'s reconcile-delete only runs when the run returned positions and hit no per-account error | A zero-position response or a per-account failure means the list can't be trusted as complete — deleting under either condition risks wiping real holdings because SnapTrade had a bad moment, not because the user actually sold |
| 2026-08-01 | `portfolioRepository.ts`'s holdings writes are per-row (`upsertHoldingsRemote`/`deleteHoldingsRemote`), not a whole-list select→delete→upsert diff; the client never sends `last_price`/`day_change_*`/`created_at` | The old shape re-diffed the entire book on every single-field edit and let a stale client overwrite Finnhub's price data. The brokerage-synced delete guard moved into the query itself (`.neq('source','snaptrade')`) so it holds regardless of caller |

## Session log

Keep entries short — a few bullets, key files, PR/commit pointer for detail. Don't re-narrate the debugging journey; that's what Decisions is for.

### 2026-08-01 — claude (session 14)
- PR 5 ("Mutation safety proper"): per-row holdings upsert/delete, trimmed client write authority, CSV Merge/Replace picker with live preview counts, per-row delete confirmation. Verified in a real browser via Playwright (dev server, not just unit tests), not only `npm test`. 63 tests green.
- PR: https://github.com/LucmanAly/Portlander/pull/17 (draft → develop). Key files: `src/lib/{mappers,portfolioRepository,csv}.ts`, `src/context/PortfolioContext.tsx`, `src/pages/PortfolioPage.tsx`, `src/components/portfolio/PortfolioTable.tsx`.
- Owner asked for this file to be trimmed — was 225 lines / 6.1k words and regrowing the bloat it was cut for on 2026-07-31. Collapsed sessions 1–12's debugging narrative into a pointer at Decisions (which already held the resolved "why"), dropped a Decisions row referencing `eventSync.ts` (deleted in PR 2), fixed a stale "known gap" note PR 4 already closed. 225 → 112 lines. Commit `51cbcf4`.

### 2026-08-01 — claude (session 13)
- PR 4 ("Data truthfulness"): real published macro dates (see Decisions), reconciled sold SnapTrade positions, per-provider sync freshness in Settings. Deployed + verified live in prod (`sync-events` v14, `snaptrade-sync` v18); `get_advisors` clean.
- PR: https://github.com/LucmanAly/Portlander/pull/16 (draft → develop).

### Sessions 1–12 (2026-03-25 – 2026-08-01)
Scaffolded the app and local demo mode, then cloud deploy (Netlify + Supabase + `sync-events` cron), then the SnapTrade brokerage integration. The SnapTrade Personal-vs-Commercial auth mismatch took several sessions to isolate; the resolved mechanism and every real bug found along the way (SDK client construction, `display_name` field casing, `cost_basis` vs a nonexistent field, `getAllAccountPositions`'s response shape) are in the Decisions table above, not repeated here. PRs #1–#13 cover this work; full narrative is in git history if needed.

## Notes for the next agent

1. **Never trust a PR number without checking** — one got merged early mid-session carrying only part of its commits. Use `list_pull_requests`/`pull_request_read` before assuming what's merged.
2. **No Supabase MCP tool exposes secrets management or Auth URL config** — any new secret needs the owner to paste it into the dashboard. **But `deploy_edge_function` works and `get_edge_function` reads deployed source back to verify** — don't hand the owner a deploy step you can do yourself.
3. **`sync-events` is deliberately global/unscoped** (shared rows, safe for any caller). **`refresh-quotes`/`snaptrade-sync` are user-scoped** (privileged per-user writes). Check which shape a new Edge Function actually needs.
4. **If a SnapTrade SDK error shows up, don't guess from docs** — download the real tarball (`npm registry` → `snaptrade-typescript-sdk`) and grep the `.d.ts`/`.mjs` directly. Every real bug here was found that way, not by reasoning about documentation.
5. **The Supabase `get_logs` MCP tool cannot read `console.error` output — confirmed dead.** Make Edge Functions return error detail in the JSON body instead, and make sure the client actually reads it (`describeFunctionError()` in `snaptradeRepository.ts` is the working pattern).
6. If a Supabase/Netlify/SnapTrade MCP connector is available, prefer it over asking the owner to click through a dashboard — check via ToolSearch rather than assuming unavailability.
7. **Keep this file lean.** Short session-log entries, delete resolved blockers, edit Decisions rows in place rather than layering corrections on top.
8. No `chromium-cli` in this environment — for Playwright verification, it's installed globally at `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules/playwright`, Chromium binary at `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium` (pass directly as `executablePath`).
